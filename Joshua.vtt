Hello

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Mateo, can you hear me?

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Yes

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
How are you? How are you?

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Good. Where are you calling from?

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Sorry, what did you say? I'm here too well.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Where are you calling it from?

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
From where?

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
I'm from Venezuela.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Caracas, again.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Oh, nice.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Yeah, I'm from Latin American.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Beautiful.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Yeah, it is really beautiful.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
You know, it's Latin America.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
There's a lot of things going on.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
I know Venezuela has a lot going on with the election president.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
Yeah, yeah, man. It's really crazy.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
But well, we tried the best, you know, first.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
So

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
I read all about the job.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
I had some question.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
Is this a full-time job or something like a house time?

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Yeah, this would be part time.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
For time. So four four hours, something like that.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
Depends each day is going to be different.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
All right.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
It also depends how fast you work.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
Right now I'm doing all the tagging myself.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
So I have a really good understanding on like how long it should take.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
So we might do something like either hourly or like per entry.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
But yeah, that's kind of how.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
We're structuring the project.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
Yeah, yeah, I already I suppose you do the marketing, right?

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Yeah.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
I do marketing too.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
I already work in, you know, instantly I.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
And yeah, it was just like me.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
I was in the marketing and repetitive response.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
But I know.

03:34.000 --> 03:41.000
Sometimes there's a lot of work, you know, and you can do it yourself.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
So yeah, I know I that's my number one rule being fast.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
I think the fast you can respond to someone.

03:48.000 --> 03:55.000
The better chance you get a sale or something like that, depending on the audience. Right.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
Yeah, 100%.

04:00.000 --> 04:10.000
Could you talk about a few of your prior projects with data entry automation.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
Well, using a CRM.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Yeah, I'm a.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
Well, let's talk about the data entry.

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
I was doing data entry and manually generation for a US company.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
So I was, you know, looking for the prospects and linking putty.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
In the Google ships and.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
And check on the on the CRM.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
I was using hotspot by the time.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
And then I.

04:44.000 --> 04:53.000
Well, with that data entry, I was getting a hundred leads a day in eight hours.

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
So I had to be fast, you know, yeah, a hundred leads daily.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
It's a lot.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
So.

05:03.000 --> 05:15.000
I do some certifications from hotspot and on email marketing and how to handle their CRM.

05:15.000 --> 05:22.000
Then I started working with a friend from Spain.

05:22.000 --> 05:32.000
I was creating doing all the warfalls, tagging properties, everything on the hotspot CRM, you know.

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
And then you also responding to emails.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Yes, yes, I had to respond to emails.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
Also, after that, I was doing.

05:44.000 --> 05:51.000
This lead generation to this was we accompany in Dominican Republic.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
I had to, you know, engage with people.

05:55.000 --> 06:03.000
I had to, you know, try to, you know, to put this person on the sales pipeline.

06:03.000 --> 06:10.000
And I had to chat to people on Instagram and respond on Instagram, Facebook.

06:10.000 --> 06:16.000
I was managing all these social media platforms, you know, so.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
I really, I really good.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
We all these.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
So.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
It went pretty well after that.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
My most recent job was we.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Another company in the NSA.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
And I wasn't sure of the email marketing.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
And as I say, I was doing all the marketing.

06:45.000 --> 06:51.000
And then I was, you know, replying the positive prayer please engaging with the prospects.

06:51.000 --> 07:01.000
Some of the negative I was you looking away to make them interested again, certain like that.

07:01.000 --> 07:09.000
So yeah, I was responding on instantly that it's.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
Really like.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
This tool.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
It's smartly.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
So.

07:20.000 --> 07:29.000
Then I was doing and sending these people in a form to sales force manually.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
So I had to check.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Sorry, what did you say?

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Have you used smartly before?

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
Yeah, one time with the.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
With this company on Dominican Republic.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
I was wondering where you are launching the campaign.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
Yeah, yeah, I was watching the campaigns there and replying to the.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
To these people from the campaigns.

07:57.000 --> 08:03.000
I went nothing chair of the marketing, but I was doing their responses.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
And then you put the entry into sales force from smart lead.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
No, by the time I was moving from.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Not only to.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
Yes, I was.

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
I was using by that time the hotspot CRM.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Okay.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
It's very similar.

08:27.000 --> 08:34.000
What we're doing is running campaigns on smart deed and then putting the data.

08:34.000 --> 08:41.000
And the prices that we get from clients into a CRM on air table.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
So you put it on the on the air table, right?

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Yeah.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Have you used air table?

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Yes, yes.

08:48.000 --> 08:57.000
And I have not working a lot with it, but you know, I know about it.

08:57.000 --> 09:03.000
Do you have any other background skills?

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Sorry, what did you say?

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
I don't hear it well.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
Like any other skills besides digital marketing.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
What are like your secondary skills?

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
Well, I'm really touched, say, be let's say.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
And I'm really proficient with.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
We, you know, any problem that.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
That probably happened is we are looking someone to find a solution.

09:31.000 --> 09:39.000
I really the person will, you know, do a extensive research or anything else to.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
To look it for a solution, right?

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
Let's say you have.

09:47.000 --> 09:53.000
A Google listing and you don't know how to do it or.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
You want to delete or want to create a new one.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
You want a solution for that.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
Or if you don't remember the password and you don't have the email.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
I look for a solution for things like it.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
I'm really proficient with chat GPD, so.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
I use it a lot.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
And yeah, because you know.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
To give the barrier response, you have to.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
To have some prompts and something like that.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
Then you have idea and.

10:22.000 --> 10:29.000
Give the best response to to the clients, right?

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
Yep.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
Make sense.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Anything else you want to know?

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
Yeah, did you have any other questions?

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
Well, my, my, my question was at least, you know, there.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
How many times was it work?

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
And yeah, it's sadly.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
What was the role?

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
It's sadly about so.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Yeah, it's pretty clear that.

11:00.000 --> 11:06.000
You know, I wrote to the campaigns artists from sales or.

11:06.000 --> 11:11.000
Or use normal responses.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Was it said again?

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
Is it for, you know, a response for selling something?

11:18.000 --> 11:23.000
Or is it just not my response from the.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
You know, for the influencers?

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
So we're emailing the influencers, giving them a brand deal.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
So say, hey.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
Influencer number one, what is your.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
Pricing for an Instagram post.

11:42.000 --> 11:49.000
And then we want them to respond like, hey, my Instagram rate is $500 for a post.

11:49.000 --> 11:55.000
And then you put his name and his price into air table.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
All right.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Yeah.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
So it's not super complicated.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
The, there's a few edge cases where.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
You're going to have to respond to the creator because they have some questions.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
But then that's where you can use chat GPT.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
Yeah, yeah.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
That's what I mean when, when you had to do a specific, you know,

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
replies when people ask something different, a question.

12:21.000 --> 12:28.000
When they answer question, it's going to be the role of this.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
Like their responsibility to.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
Look at our campaign brief and the brief has the answers to all the questions a creator might ask.

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
And then you basically just respond.

12:42.000 --> 12:50.000
And then the tagging the tagging portion is labeling whether the creator was interested, not interested.

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
And then if they were interested and they gave the pricing, then you can.

12:55.000 --> 13:01.000
Select another tag that basically says like, okay, it was added to air table.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
And then sometimes the.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
The creator has like a location in a niche.

13:07.000 --> 13:14.000
And then there's like a couple things just to add to the CRM like about that person.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
All right, I got it.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Yeah, it looks really simple.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
It's something that I have really doing in the past.

13:22.000 --> 13:27.000
Well, that was my last job on the email marketing.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Awesome.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
So I have about six more interviews.

13:32.000 --> 13:42.000
It looks like almost all of them are charging ten dollars or below.

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
So I'm curious if you're pricing is firm at 20.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
Or if it's flexible.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
All right, what do you say at the last?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
I don't hear it pretty well.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
I was asking me if your rate is flexible.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
If the rate is is flexible.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
Yeah.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
Well, let's look.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
It was just then, right?

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Are you funny?

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
But a lot of the other people that applied put 10.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
So I just wanted to be transparent.

14:17.000 --> 14:22.000
Because we'll probably go with someone closer to 10.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Yeah, yeah, it is possible to 10.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
I do me proposal for 10.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Okay.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
Yeah, no, there's no problem with that.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
Okay, great.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Awesome.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
And you prefer a viewer.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Yes.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Okay.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Cool.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
Nice to meet you, Aver.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
Nice to meet you, Matt.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
So we see in the chat.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
I think I guess you had some more interviews, right?

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Yeah, some more interviews.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
And I'm going to talk to my team.

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
And I'll message you when I have more information.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
All right.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Well, nice to meet you, Matt.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Hope you like what I do.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
And we'll talk there.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Aver.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Adios.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Awesome.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Have a nice night.
