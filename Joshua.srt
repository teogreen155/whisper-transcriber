00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hello

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Mateo, can you hear me?

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
How are you? How are you?

9
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Good. Where are you calling from?

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Sorry, what did you say? I'm here too well.

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Where are you calling it from?

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
From where?

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm from Venezuela.

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Caracas, again.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Oh, nice.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah, I'm from Latin American.

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Beautiful.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah, it is really beautiful.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You know, it's Latin America.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
There's a lot of things going on.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah, yeah.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I know Venezuela has a lot going on with the election president.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yeah, yeah, man. It's really crazy.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But well, we tried the best, you know, first.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I read all about the job.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I had some question.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Is this a full-time job or something like a house time?

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yeah, this would be part time.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
For time. So four four hours, something like that.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Depends each day is going to be different.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
All right.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It also depends how fast you work.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Right now I'm doing all the tagging myself.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So I have a really good understanding on like how long it should take.

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So we might do something like either hourly or like per entry.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But yeah, that's kind of how.

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We're structuring the project.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yeah, yeah, I already I suppose you do the marketing, right?

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah.

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I do marketing too.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I already work in, you know, instantly I.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And yeah, it was just like me.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I was in the marketing and repetitive response.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But I know.

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Sometimes there's a lot of work, you know, and you can do it yourself.

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So yeah, I know I that's my number one rule being fast.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I think the fast you can respond to someone.

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The better chance you get a sale or something like that, depending on the audience. Right.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah, 100%.

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Could you talk about a few of your prior projects with data entry automation.

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Well, using a CRM.

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yeah, I'm a.

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Well, let's talk about the data entry.

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I was doing data entry and manually generation for a US company.

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So I was, you know, looking for the prospects and linking putty.

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
In the Google ships and.

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And check on the on the CRM.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I was using hotspot by the time.

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And then I.

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Well, with that data entry, I was getting a hundred leads a day in eight hours.

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So I had to be fast, you know, yeah, a hundred leads daily.

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's a lot.

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So.

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I do some certifications from hotspot and on email marketing and how to handle their CRM.

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Then I started working with a friend from Spain.

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I was creating doing all the warfalls, tagging properties, everything on the hotspot CRM, you know.

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And then you also responding to emails.

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yes, yes, I had to respond to emails.

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Also, after that, I was doing.

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This lead generation to this was we accompany in Dominican Republic.

72
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I had to, you know, engage with people.

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I had to, you know, try to, you know, to put this person on the sales pipeline.

74
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And I had to chat to people on Instagram and respond on Instagram, Facebook.

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I was managing all these social media platforms, you know, so.

76
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I really, I really good.

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
We all these.

78
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So.

79
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It went pretty well after that.

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
My most recent job was we.

81
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Another company in the NSA.

82
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And I wasn't sure of the email marketing.

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And as I say, I was doing all the marketing.

84
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And then I was, you know, replying the positive prayer please engaging with the prospects.

85
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Some of the negative I was you looking away to make them interested again, certain like that.

86
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So yeah, I was responding on instantly that it's.

87
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Really like.

88
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This tool.

89
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's smartly.

90
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So.

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Then I was doing and sending these people in a form to sales force manually.

92
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So I had to check.

93
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Sorry, what did you say?

94
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Have you used smartly before?

95
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah, one time with the.

96
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
With this company on Dominican Republic.

97
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I was wondering where you are launching the campaign.

98
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah, yeah, I was watching the campaigns there and replying to the.

99
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
To these people from the campaigns.

100
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I went nothing chair of the marketing, but I was doing their responses.

101
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And then you put the entry into sales force from smart lead.

102
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
No, by the time I was moving from.

103
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Not only to.

104
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yes, I was.

105
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I was using by that time the hotspot CRM.

106
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Okay.

107
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's very similar.

108
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What we're doing is running campaigns on smart deed and then putting the data.

109
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And the prices that we get from clients into a CRM on air table.

110
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So you put it on the on the air table, right?

111
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yeah.

112
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Have you used air table?

113
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yes, yes.

114
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And I have not working a lot with it, but you know, I know about it.

115
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Do you have any other background skills?

116
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Sorry, what did you say?

117
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I don't hear it well.

118
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Like any other skills besides digital marketing.

119
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What are like your secondary skills?

120
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Well, I'm really touched, say, be let's say.

121
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And I'm really proficient with.

122
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
We, you know, any problem that.

123
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That probably happened is we are looking someone to find a solution.

124
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I really the person will, you know, do a extensive research or anything else to.

125
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
To look it for a solution, right?

126
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Let's say you have.

127
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
A Google listing and you don't know how to do it or.

128
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You want to delete or want to create a new one.

129
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You want a solution for that.

130
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Or if you don't remember the password and you don't have the email.

131
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I look for a solution for things like it.

132
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm really proficient with chat GPD, so.

133
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I use it a lot.

134
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And yeah, because you know.

135
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
To give the barrier response, you have to.

136
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
To have some prompts and something like that.

137
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Then you have idea and.

138
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Give the best response to to the clients, right?

139
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yep.

140
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Make sense.

141
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Anything else you want to know?

142
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yeah, did you have any other questions?

143
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Well, my, my, my question was at least, you know, there.

144
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
How many times was it work?

145
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And yeah, it's sadly.

146
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What was the role?

147
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's sadly about so.

148
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yeah, it's pretty clear that.

149
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You know, I wrote to the campaigns artists from sales or.

150
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Or use normal responses.

151
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Was it said again?

152
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Is it for, you know, a response for selling something?

153
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Or is it just not my response from the.

154
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You know, for the influencers?

155
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So we're emailing the influencers, giving them a brand deal.

156
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So say, hey.

157
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Influencer number one, what is your.

158
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Pricing for an Instagram post.

159
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And then we want them to respond like, hey, my Instagram rate is $500 for a post.

160
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And then you put his name and his price into air table.

161
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
All right.

162
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yeah.

163
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So it's not super complicated.

164
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
The, there's a few edge cases where.

165
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You're going to have to respond to the creator because they have some questions.

166
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But then that's where you can use chat GPT.

167
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yeah, yeah.

168
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
That's what I mean when, when you had to do a specific, you know,

169
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
replies when people ask something different, a question.

170
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
When they answer question, it's going to be the role of this.

171
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Like their responsibility to.

172
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Look at our campaign brief and the brief has the answers to all the questions a creator might ask.

173
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And then you basically just respond.

174
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And then the tagging the tagging portion is labeling whether the creator was interested, not interested.

175
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And then if they were interested and they gave the pricing, then you can.

176
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Select another tag that basically says like, okay, it was added to air table.

177
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And then sometimes the.

178
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The creator has like a location in a niche.

179
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And then there's like a couple things just to add to the CRM like about that person.

180
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
All right, I got it.

181
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yeah, it looks really simple.

182
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's something that I have really doing in the past.

183
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Well, that was my last job on the email marketing.

184
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Awesome.

185
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So I have about six more interviews.

186
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It looks like almost all of them are charging ten dollars or below.

187
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So I'm curious if you're pricing is firm at 20.

188
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Or if it's flexible.

189
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
All right, what do you say at the last?

190
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I don't hear it pretty well.

191
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I was asking me if your rate is flexible.

192
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
If the rate is is flexible.

193
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah.

194
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Well, let's look.

195
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It was just then, right?

196
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Are you funny?

197
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But a lot of the other people that applied put 10.

198
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So I just wanted to be transparent.

199
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Because we'll probably go with someone closer to 10.

200
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yeah, yeah, it is possible to 10.

201
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I do me proposal for 10.

202
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Okay.

203
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah, no, there's no problem with that.

204
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Okay, great.

205
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Awesome.

206
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And you prefer a viewer.

207
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yes.

208
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Okay.

209
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Cool.

210
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Nice to meet you, Aver.

211
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Nice to meet you, Matt.

212
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So we see in the chat.

213
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I think I guess you had some more interviews, right?

214
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yeah, some more interviews.

215
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And I'm going to talk to my team.

216
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And I'll message you when I have more information.

217
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
All right.

218
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Well, nice to meet you, Matt.

219
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Hope you like what I do.

220
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And we'll talk there.

221
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Aver.

222
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Adios.

223
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Awesome.

224
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Have a nice night.
