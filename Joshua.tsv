93000	95000	How are you? How are you?
95000	97000	Good. Where are you calling from?
99000	102000	Sorry, what did you say? I'm here too well.
102000	104000	Where are you calling it from?
105000	107000	From where?
107000	109000	I'm from Venezuela.
109000	111000	Caracas, again.
111000	112000	Oh, nice.
112000	115000	Yeah, I'm from Latin American.

120000	122000	You know, it's Latin America.
122000	124000	There's a lot of things going on.
124000	126000	Yeah, yeah.
126000	131000	I know Venezuela has a lot going on with the election president.
131000	135000	Yeah, yeah, man. It's really crazy.
135000	140000	But well, we tried the best, you know, first.
140000	143000	So
143000	148000	I read all about the job.
148000	150000	I had some question.
150000	155000	Is this a full-time job or something like a house time?
155000	157000	Yeah, this would be part time.
157000	162000	For time. So four four hours, something like that.
162000	165000	Depends each day is going to be different.
165000	167000	All right.
167000	171000	It also depends how fast you work.
171000	174000	Right now I'm doing all the tagging myself.
174000	179000	So I have a really good understanding on like how long it should take.
179000	184000	So we might do something like either hourly or like per entry.
184000	187000	But yeah, that's kind of how.
187000	191000	We're structuring the project.
191000	196000	Yeah, yeah, I already I suppose you do the marketing, right?
196000	198000	Yeah.
198000	201000	I do marketing too.
201000	206000	I already work in, you know, instantly I.
206000	209000	And yeah, it was just like me.
209000	212000	I was in the marketing and repetitive response.
212000	214000	But I know.
214000	221000	Sometimes there's a lot of work, you know, and you can do it yourself.
221000	225000	So yeah, I know I that's my number one rule being fast.
225000	228000	I think the fast you can respond to someone.
228000	235000	The better chance you get a sale or something like that, depending on the audience. Right.
235000	240000	Yeah, 100%.
240000	250000	Could you talk about a few of your prior projects with data entry automation.
250000	253000	Well, using a CRM.
253000	255000	Yeah, I'm a.
255000	259000	Well, let's talk about the data entry.
259000	265000	I was doing data entry and manually generation for a US company.
265000	271000	So I was, you know, looking for the prospects and linking putty.
271000	274000	In the Google ships and.
274000	278000	And check on the on the CRM.
278000	281000	I was using hotspot by the time.
281000	284000	And then I.
284000	293000	Well, with that data entry, I was getting a hundred leads a day in eight hours.
293000	299000	So I had to be fast, you know, yeah, a hundred leads daily.
299000	301000	It's a lot.
301000	303000	So.
303000	315000	I do some certifications from hotspot and on email marketing and how to handle their CRM.
315000	322000	Then I started working with a friend from Spain.
322000	332000	I was creating doing all the warfalls, tagging properties, everything on the hotspot CRM, you know.
332000	337000	And then you also responding to emails.
337000	339000	Yes, yes, I had to respond to emails.
339000	344000	Also, after that, I was doing.
344000	351000	This lead generation to this was we accompany in Dominican Republic.
351000	355000	I had to, you know, engage with people.
355000	363000	I had to, you know, try to, you know, to put this person on the sales pipeline.
363000	370000	And I had to chat to people on Instagram and respond on Instagram, Facebook.
370000	376000	I was managing all these social media platforms, you know, so.
376000	379000	I really, I really good.
379000	382000	We all these.
382000	386000	So.
386000	390000	It went pretty well after that.
390000	394000	My most recent job was we.
394000	396000	Another company in the NSA.
396000	401000	And I wasn't sure of the email marketing.
401000	405000	And as I say, I was doing all the marketing.
405000	411000	And then I was, you know, replying the positive prayer please engaging with the prospects.
411000	421000	Some of the negative I was you looking away to make them interested again, certain like that.
421000	429000	So yeah, I was responding on instantly that it's.
429000	433000	Really like.
433000	436000	This tool.
436000	438000	It's smartly.
438000	440000	So.
440000	449000	Then I was doing and sending these people in a form to sales force manually.
449000	452000	So I had to check.
452000	454000	Sorry, what did you say?
454000	457000	Have you used smartly before?
457000	460000	Yeah, one time with the.
460000	464000	With this company on Dominican Republic.
464000	469000	I was wondering where you are launching the campaign.
469000	474000	Yeah, yeah, I was watching the campaigns there and replying to the.
474000	477000	To these people from the campaigns.
477000	483000	I went nothing chair of the marketing, but I was doing their responses.
483000	488000	And then you put the entry into sales force from smart lead.
488000	493000	No, by the time I was moving from.
493000	496000	Not only to.
496000	499000	Yes, I was.
499000	504000	I was using by that time the hotspot CRM.
504000	506000	Okay.
506000	507000	It's very similar.
507000	514000	What we're doing is running campaigns on smart deed and then putting the data.
514000	521000	And the prices that we get from clients into a CRM on air table.
521000	524000	So you put it on the on the air table, right?
524000	525000	Yeah.
525000	527000	Have you used air table?
527000	528000	Yes, yes.
528000	537000	And I have not working a lot with it, but you know, I know about it.
537000	543000	Do you have any other background skills?
543000	544000	Sorry, what did you say?
544000	545000	I don't hear it well.
545000	550000	Like any other skills besides digital marketing.
550000	553000	What are like your secondary skills?
553000	558000	Well, I'm really touched, say, be let's say.
558000	562000	And I'm really proficient with.
562000	566000	We, you know, any problem that.
566000	571000	That probably happened is we are looking someone to find a solution.
571000	579000	I really the person will, you know, do a extensive research or anything else to.
579000	583000	To look it for a solution, right?
583000	587000	Let's say you have.
587000	593000	A Google listing and you don't know how to do it or.
593000	596000	You want to delete or want to create a new one.
596000	598000	You want a solution for that.
598000	602000	Or if you don't remember the password and you don't have the email.
602000	605000	I look for a solution for things like it.
605000	608000	I'm really proficient with chat GPD, so.
608000	610000	I use it a lot.
610000	613000	And yeah, because you know.
613000	617000	To give the barrier response, you have to.
617000	619000	To have some prompts and something like that.
619000	622000	Then you have idea and.
622000	629000	Give the best response to to the clients, right?
629000	632000	Yep.
632000	635000	Make sense.
635000	638000	Anything else you want to know?
638000	643000	Yeah, did you have any other questions?
643000	647000	Well, my, my, my question was at least, you know, there.
647000	651000	How many times was it work?
651000	654000	And yeah, it's sadly.
654000	655000	What was the role?
655000	658000	It's sadly about so.
658000	660000	Yeah, it's pretty clear that.
660000	666000	You know, I wrote to the campaigns artists from sales or.
666000	671000	Or use normal responses.
671000	673000	Was it said again?
673000	678000	Is it for, you know, a response for selling something?
678000	683000	Or is it just not my response from the.
683000	686000	You know, for the influencers?
686000	691000	So we're emailing the influencers, giving them a brand deal.
691000	695000	So say, hey.
695000	698000	Influencer number one, what is your.
698000	702000	Pricing for an Instagram post.
702000	709000	And then we want them to respond like, hey, my Instagram rate is $500 for a post.
709000	715000	And then you put his name and his price into air table.
715000	717000	All right.
717000	719000	Yeah.
719000	721000	So it's not super complicated.
721000	724000	The, there's a few edge cases where.
724000	727000	You're going to have to respond to the creator because they have some questions.
727000	730000	But then that's where you can use chat GPT.
730000	733000	Yeah, yeah.
733000	737000	That's what I mean when, when you had to do a specific, you know,
737000	741000	replies when people ask something different, a question.
741000	748000	When they answer question, it's going to be the role of this.
748000	751000	Like their responsibility to.
751000	757000	Look at our campaign brief and the brief has the answers to all the questions a creator might ask.
757000	762000	And then you basically just respond.
762000	770000	And then the tagging the tagging portion is labeling whether the creator was interested, not interested.
770000	775000	And then if they were interested and they gave the pricing, then you can.
775000	781000	Select another tag that basically says like, okay, it was added to air table.
781000	784000	And then sometimes the.
784000	787000	The creator has like a location in a niche.
787000	794000	And then there's like a couple things just to add to the CRM like about that person.
794000	796000	All right, I got it.
796000	798000	Yeah, it looks really simple.
798000	802000	It's something that I have really doing in the past.
802000	807000	Well, that was my last job on the email marketing.
807000	809000	Awesome.
809000	812000	So I have about six more interviews.
812000	822000	It looks like almost all of them are charging ten dollars or below.
822000	827000	So I'm curious if you're pricing is firm at 20.
827000	830000	Or if it's flexible.
830000	832000	All right, what do you say at the last?
832000	834000	I don't hear it pretty well.
834000	838000	I was asking me if your rate is flexible.
838000	841000	If the rate is is flexible.
841000	844000	Yeah.
844000	847000	Well, let's look.
847000	850000	It was just then, right?
850000	852000	Are you funny?
852000	855000	But a lot of the other people that applied put 10.
855000	857000	So I just wanted to be transparent.
857000	862000	Because we'll probably go with someone closer to 10.
862000	864000	Yeah, yeah, it is possible to 10.
864000	867000	I do me proposal for 10.
867000	868000	Okay.
868000	872000	Yeah, no, there's no problem with that.
872000	875000	Okay, great.
875000	876000	Awesome.
876000	879000	And you prefer a viewer.
879000	880000	Yes.
880000	881000	Okay.
881000	882000	Cool.
882000	886000	Nice to meet you, Aver.
886000	890000	Nice to meet you, Matt.
890000	891000	So we see in the chat.
891000	895000	I think I guess you had some more interviews, right?
895000	896000	Yeah, some more interviews.
896000	898000	And I'm going to talk to my team.
898000	903000	And I'll message you when I have more information.
903000	904000	All right.
904000	906000	Well, nice to meet you, Matt.
907000	909000	Hope you like what I do.
909000	912000	And we'll talk there.
912000	914000	Aver.
914000	915000	Adios.
915000	916000	Awesome.
916000	918000	Have a nice night.
